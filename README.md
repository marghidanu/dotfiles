## Setup

Before you begin, you will need to install `brew` onto your system.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the steps at the end to finalize your installation. Now we can install the rest of the applications:

```
brew bundle -v
```

Once everything is in place,  let's configure the system:

```
werk run
```
